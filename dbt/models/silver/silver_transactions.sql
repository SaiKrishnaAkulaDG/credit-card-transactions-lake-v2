-- Silver Transactions: Validated and enriched transaction records from Bronze
--
-- PROMOTION LOGIC:
--   1. Read Bronze transactions for the specified date
--   2. Exclude records already in quarantine (deduplication guard)
--   3. Join with Silver Transaction Codes to get debit_credit_indicator
--   4. Apply sign to amount based on DR (positive) / CR (negative)
--   5. Flag account_id resolvability against Silver Accounts (unresolved = false, not quarantined)
--   6. Timestamp promotion with current_timestamp
--
-- PARTITIONING: date=YYYY-MM-DD (inherited from Bronze source date)
-- IDEMPOTENCY: Re-running same date produces identical results (external materialization overwrites)
-- DEDUPLICATION: transaction_id uniqueness enforced across all partitions (SIL-T-02)
--
-- AUDIT COLUMNS:
--   _signed_amount: Amount with sign (DR=+, CR=-) — used in Gold aggregations
--   _is_resolvable: False if account_id not in Silver Accounts — excluded from Gold until backfilled
--   _pipeline_run_id: Execution identifier (INV-04 — non-null, enforced by test)
--   _bronze_ingested_at: Carried from Bronze ingestion timestamp
--   _source_file: Carried from Bronze source filename
--   _promoted_at: UTC timestamp when record entered Silver layer
--
-- CONSTRAINTS: SIL-T-02 (unique tx_id), SIL-T-08 (resolvability), INV-04 (non-null run_id)
