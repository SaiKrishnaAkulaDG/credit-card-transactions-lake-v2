-- Gold — Weekly Account Transaction Aggregates
--
-- One record per account per ISO week (Monday to Sunday).
-- Only includes accounts with at least one resolvable transaction in the week.
-- Aggregates transactions by type: PURCHASE (count & avg), PAYMENT/FEE/INTEREST (sums).
--
-- AGGREGATION LOGIC:
--   1. Filter Silver transactions where _is_resolvable = true
--   2. Group by account_id and ISO week (Monday = week_start)
--   3. Compute: PURCHASE count & average amount
--   4. Compute: PAYMENT, FEE, INTEREST amounts (sums by type)
--   5. Join to Silver Accounts to get closing_balance (current account balance)
--   6. Only include account+week combinations with resolvable transactions
--
-- CONSTRAINTS: GOLD-W-01 (unique account+week), GOLD-W-05 (closing_balance non-null via INNER JOIN)
-- MATERIALIZATION: external (non-partitioned, overwrites on re-run)
