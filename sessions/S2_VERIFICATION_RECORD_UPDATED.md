## Task 2.1 — run_logger.py: Append-Only Run Log Writer

### Test Cases Applied

| Case | Scenario | Expected | Result |
|------|----------|----------|--------|
| TC-1 | First write — file absent | run_log.parquet created with 1 row | ✅ PASS |
| TC-2 | Second write — file present | run_log.parquet has 2 rows; first row unchanged (RL-01b) | ✅ PASS |
| TC-3 | SUCCESS record | error_message is null | ✅ PASS |
| TC-4 | Bronze record | records_rejected is null (RL-04) | ✅ PASS |
| TC-5 | Gold record | records_rejected is null (RL-04) | ✅ PASS |
| TC-6 | FAILED record with path in message | Path separators stripped from error_message (RL-05b) | ✅ PASS |
| TC-7 | get_run_log() — file absent | Returns empty DataFrame | ✅ PASS |

**Challenge Verdict:** CLEAN

## Task 2.2 — bronze_loader.py: CSV-to-Parquet Ingestion

### Test Cases Applied

| Case | Scenario | Expected | Result |
|------|----------|----------|--------|
| TC-1 | Clean CSV — first ingestion | status=SUCCESS; Parquet at correct path; row count matches source | ✅ PASS |
| TC-2 | Rerun same CSV (idempotent) | status=SUCCESS; no rewrite; row count unchanged (INV-01a) | ✅ PASS |
| TC-3 | Partition exists, row count matches | SUCCESS returned immediately | ✅ PASS |
| TC-4 | Partition exists, row count mismatches | Partition deleted, re-ingested (S1B-03) | ✅ PASS |
| TC-5 | Source file absent | status=SKIPPED; no Parquet written (GAP-INV-02) | ✅ PASS |
| TC-6 | Schema mismatch | status=FAILED; no Parquet written (S1B-schema) | ✅ PASS |
| TC-7 | Audit columns present and non-null | _pipeline_run_id, _ingested_at, _source_file all non-null (INV-04) | ✅ PASS |
| TC-8 | Source columns preserved exactly | All source values unchanged in Bronze (INV-08) | ✅ PASS |
| TC-9 | Source file unchanged after ingestion | MD5 hash identical before and after call (INV-06) | ✅ PASS |
| TC-10 | Bronze path convention correct | Path is `bronze/{entity}/date={date_str}/data.parquet` (INV-10) | ✅ PASS |

**Challenge Verdict:** CLEAN

## Task 2.3 — control_manager.py: Watermark Management

### Test Cases Applied

| Case | Scenario | Expected | Result |
|------|----------|----------|--------|
| TC-1 | get_watermark — file absent | Returns None | ✅ PASS |
| TC-2 | set_watermark then get_watermark | Returns set date | ✅ PASS |
| TC-3 | get_next_date — no watermark | Returns None | ✅ PASS |
| TC-4 | get_next_date — watermark 2024-01-05 | Returns "2024-01-06" | ✅ PASS |
| TC-5 | Control table initialized | pipeline/control.parquet created | ✅ PASS |
| TC-cold-start | get_watermark on fresh env → None returned | None returned cleanly; no exception raised | ✅ PASS |

**Challenge Verdict:** CLEAN

## Task 2.4 — pipeline_historical.py: Historical Pipeline Entry Point

### Test Cases Applied

| Case | Scenario | Expected | Result |
|------|----------|----------|--------|
| TC-1 | Full run 2024-01-01 to 2024-01-06 | 6 transaction + 6 accounts + 1 transaction_codes Bronze partitions | ✅ PASS |
| TC-2 | Run log entries written | run_log.parquet has rows for all models all 6 dates | ✅ PASS |
| TC-3 | Ascending date order | Run log entries per date in ascending order (GAP-INV-01a) | ✅ PASS |
| TC-4 | Within-date sequence | bronze_transaction_codes, bronze_accounts, bronze_transactions (GAP-INV-01b) | ✅ PASS |
| TC-5 | Idempotent rerun | Bronze row counts unchanged on second run; new run_id in run_log | ✅ PASS |
| TC-6 | S1B-02 | Row counts identical between first and second run for same date | ✅ PASS |

**Challenge Verdict:** CLEAN

## Code Review

**Invariants verified:**
- INV-04: All Bronze records carry non-null _pipeline_run_id ✅
- INV-01a: Row-count idempotency enforced ✅
- INV-02: Watermark advancement deferred to S5 ✅
- S1B-05: run_log.parquet written exclusively by run_logger.py ✅

---

## Scope Decisions

None — all Bronze layer tasks executed as planned.

---

## BCE Impact

No BCE artifact impact.

---

## Verification Verdict

✅ All planned cases passed  
✅ Challenge agent verdict: CLEAN  
✅ Code review complete  
✅ Scope decisions documented  

**Status:** S2 Bronze ingestion verified and ready for S3 Silver transformation

---

## Integration Verification

```bash
docker compose run --rm pipeline python << 'EOF'
import duckdb
conn = duckdb.connect()

# Verify Bronze counts
tx = conn.execute("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM read_parquet('/app/bronze/transactions/date=*/data.parquet')").fetchone()[0]
acc = conn.execute("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM read_parquet('/app/bronze/accounts/date=*/data.parquet')").fetchone()[0]
tc = conn.execute("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM read_parquet('/app/bronze/transaction_codes/date=*/data.parquet')").fetchone()[0]

# Verify run log
log = conn.execute("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM read_parquet('/app/pipeline/run_log.parquet')").fetchone()[0]

assert tx == 24 and acc == 18 and tc == 5, 'Count mismatch'
print(f'S2 INTEGRATION PASS — tx: {tx}, acc: {acc}, tc: {tc}, log: {log}')
EOF
```

**Result:** ✅ PASS  
- Transactions: 24 rows ✓
- Accounts: 18 rows ✓
- Transaction codes: 5 rows ✓
- Run log: 19 entries ✓
- Idempotency: verified ✓
